  <h1 Style="color:#333; font-size:20px; text-align:center;">ANCIENT HISTORY OF THE  LUCENA SITE</h1>

<p class="ancient">A long time ago, the site that became Lucena was under water. During the Pleistoncene Age(age of fire and water) most of what became the Philippine archipelago was 200 meters below the sea. When the ice was formed in both the Artic and Antartic continents, a long process of glaciation(ice formation) gradually occured and the water level dropped.</p>

<p class="ancient">Sea shells and limestones found in Tayabas, Padre Burgos, Atimonan, and all coastal towns in Quezon Province are proofs of their being under sea water for hundreds of thousand years.</p>

<p class = "ancient">When the water subsided to almost the present level the topography changed enabling flora and fauna to grow</p>


<p class="ancient">Before the Spaniards came, the Lucena site was inhabited by the Aetas who called the place Marico in honor of their tribal chief by the same name. When the brown skinned settlers came they bought the site with a gold necklace from the chief Marico who led his Aeta tribe to higher ground.</p>

<p class="ancient">When the Spaniards came in 1595 they were impressed by the beauty of the site they named it Buenavista. During the governorship of Governor Oroquita the place was named Oroquita. Because of the periodic raids of the Moros, the Spanish government fotified the place and called it Cotta.</p>
